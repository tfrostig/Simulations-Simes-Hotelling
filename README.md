# Simulations-Simes-Hotelling
Repository hold simulations and real-data example for Simes Hotelling paper


The following project allows to replicate results from Simes Hotelling including tables, plots and real data example. 


To replicate simulation results: 
1. Open project
2. Source ('Simulation Functions') contains the required functions as well as installation for the required packages. 
3. Open file Run simulations, change parameters as required. 
##### Running simulations - run simulations. 
Applies the following simulations including: Parametric type I error, Parametric power, 
Non-equal covariance matrices type I error, Non-equal covariance matrices power.
The files are stored in the appropriate dirctories named Type I error, and Power. 
Each simulations can be replicated indvidually by accessing the files through the named directories. 
4. Plotting the results 
#### Plotting results 
Plots all the results and stores them in the appropriate Image directory. 


To replicate real data example: 
1. Open project. 
2. Navigate to the Real data example directory 
3. Run file Real data example
